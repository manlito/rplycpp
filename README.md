# rplycpp
A C++ Wrapper for RPLy.

The original RPLy library can be found at http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/rply/.

## Motivation

I wanted to use the library, but without renaming functions in order to avoid name conflicts. At the end decided to completely wrap it, so now we have a single class (and enums) in a single namespace.
